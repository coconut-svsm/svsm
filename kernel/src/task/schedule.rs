//! Round-Robin scheduler implementation for COCONUT-SVSM
//!
//! This module implements a round-robin scheduler for cooperative multi-tasking.
//! It works by assigning a single owner for each struct [`Task`]. The owner
//! depends on the state of the task:
//!
//! * [`RUNNING`] A task in running state is owned by the [`RunQueue`] and either
//!    stored in the `run_list` (when the task is not actively running) or in
//!    `current_task` when it is scheduled on the CPU.
//! * [`BLOCKED`] A task in this state is waiting for an event to become runnable
//!    again. It is owned by a wait object when in this state.
//! * [`TERMINATED`] The task is about to be destroyed and owned by the [`RunQueue`].
//!
//! The scheduler is cooperative. A task runs until it voluntarily calls the
//! [`schedule()`] function.
//!
//! Only when a task is in [`RUNNING`] or [`TERMINATED`] state it is assigned to a
//! specific CPU. Tasks in the [`BLOCKED`] state have no CPU assigned and will run
//! on the CPU where their event is triggered that makes them [`RUNNING`] again.
//!
//! [`RUNNING`]: super::tasks::TaskState::RUNNING
//! [`BLOCKED`]: super::tasks::TaskState::BLOCKED
//! [`TERMINATED`]: super::tasks::TaskState::TERMINATED

/// want to switch the shadow stacks.
///
/// There's one major problem though: `saveprevssp` needs to access both the
/// previous and the new shadow stack, but we only map each shadow stack into a
/// single task's page tables. If each set of page tables only has access to
/// either the previous or the new shadow stack, but not both, we can't execute
/// `saveprevssp` and so we we can't move the shadow stack restore token to the
/// previous shadow stack. If there's no shadow stack restore token on the
/// previous shadow stack that means we can't restore this shadow stack at a
/// later point. To work around this, we map another shadow stack into each
/// CPU's set of pagetables. This allows us to do the following:
///
/// 1. Switch to the context-switch shadow stack using `rstorssp`.
/// 2. Transfer the shadow stack restore token from the context switch shadow
///    stack to the previous shadow stack by executing `saveprevssp`.
/// 3. Switch the page tables. This doesn't lead to problems with the context
///    switch shadow stack because it's mapped into both page tables.
/// 4. Switch to the new shadow stack using `rstorssp`.
/// 5. Transfer the shadow stack restore token from the new shadow stack back
///    to the context switch shadow stacks by executing `saveprevssp`.
///
/// We just switched between two shadow stack tables in different page tables :)
